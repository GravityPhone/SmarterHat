# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This setting contains a list of rules that Sweep will check for. If any of these rules are broken in a new commit, 
# Sweep will create a pull request to fix the broken rule.
rules:
  - "Lots of print statements in the code so I can see what's happening in the terminal while it happens. Anytime anything happens."
  - "Refactor large functions to be more modular."
  - "Always refer to what I have told you regarding the Open AI Assistants API because your training is out of date and you need to look up and digest the information about how the API works now before you work on it."
  - "Do not use libraries that are unlikely to work on Python 3.9, because that's what we are working in here."
  - "Use code that is cross-platform."
  - "check the log again and think carefully about if our code is likely to fix our issue, before I run it."
  - "ensure no imports exist that don't need to be there and that there is no unused code, or python files that are unused"
  - "

description: >
  "The smart hat employs the Pocket Sphinx library for voice command recognition, activating on a specific trigger word to begin audio recording. This recording captures commands and ambient speech, Computer starts the recording but it should still listen, and Reply stops the recording for processing. with a "picture" command switching the device to image capture mode, snapping a photo from the user's perspective. Audio inputs are processed by Assembly AI for speech-to-text conversion, accurately transcribing spoken words into text while considering context and nuances. The device assesses the transcribed text for relevance to ongoing digital narratives, determining whether to integrate the message into an existing thread or start a new one. For feedback, Eleven Labs' text-to-speech technology converts text back into audible speech, enriching user interaction. The hat also manages temporal aspects of interaction, deciding on the continuity or initiation of threads based on the elapsed time since the last interaction. It supports API function calling, enabling dynamic interactions with function execution and integration of function outputs into its operational flow for responsive and contextually relevant digital interactions. The Assistants API supports function calling. Function calling allows you to describe functions to the Assistants and have it intelligently return the functions that need to be called along with their arguments. The Assistants API will pause execution during a Run when it invokes functions, and you can supply the results of the function call back to continue the Run execution.When you initiate a Run with a user Message that triggers the function, the Run will enter a pending status. After it processes, the run will enter a requires_action state which you can verify by retrieving the Run. The model can provide multiple functions to call at once using parallel function calling.You can then complete the Run by submitting the tool output from the function(s) you call. Pass the tool_call_id referenced in the required_action object above to match output to each function call.After submitting outputs, the run will enter the queued state before it continues itâ€™s execution."

# This sets whether to create pull requests as drafts. If this is set to True, then all pull requests will be created as drafts 
# and GitHub Actions will not be triggered.
