To set up the OpenAI assistant's function schema in the application, define the schema as shown in the example below.

Example schema:
{
    "name": "get_weather",

    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The city and state e.g. San Francisco, CA"
            },
